# 4447_final

Brian McCabe and Liam Pronovost

This is the repository for our 4447 final project. Our project analyzes 15 years of Premier League Data. We investigate a number of elements, some of them being referee bias and Home Field advantage as it relates to goals, wins, and fouls. 

All of our data was downloaded from https://sports-statistics.com/
